# DND-Choose-Your-Adventure
My choose your adventure game is a game where the user has to make the right choices to win the game. Choose wisely and think about the path or you will die in the dungeon and lose! 

# My personal reason for making this
I choose this project because I enjoy story telling and play lots of Dungeon & Dragons in my free time. I love the aspect of creating a story with multiple options depending on what the person playing wants to do.

# How to play
You pick the options that are presented on the screen to venture further in and progress through the story.
